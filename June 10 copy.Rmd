<!-- comment function: Command + shift + C 
     run line function: command + return -->

<!-- Operators -->
TRUE & TRUE <!-- "&" functions like AND in CPSC121 -->
TRUE & FALSE

<!-- note: lowercase text makes objects. UPPERCASE is value -->

<!-- == means "enquiry into the data. Not "equal to." Issa boolean operator -->
<!-- "<-" or "=" means instantiate the object. manifests a new thing -->
x = 7 <!-- aka x <- 2 -->
x == 2 <!-- returns TRUE. Because x is indeed =  -->
x == 7 <!-- returns false. Because x does not = 7. -->

<!-- Using == and & together -->
name = "Fred"
(x == 2) & (name == "Fred") <!-- note that brackets are not necessary to R syntax but it helps look understandable -->

<!-- "|" means "OR" like in CPSC121 -->
(x == 2) | (name == "Fred")

<!-- "!" is NOT boolean operator -->
!TRUE <!-- returns FALSE -->
name == "Fred" <!-- return FALSE -->
name != "Fred" <!-- returns TRUE -->

<!-- Vectors: a collection of data. Like an array in Java. -->
city <- c("Vancouver", "Victoria", "Delta", "Surrey") <!-- note this syntax structure. the c(..) is important-->
                                                      <!-- Each data piece has a index number. That is their place in line. -->
city-temp <- c(25, 20, 27, 30) <!-- 
                                                      
<!-- Extracting a data point:  -->
city[1] returns "Vancouver"
city [2] returns "Victoria"
city [5] returns "NA" because it does not exist
