If you add TRUE + TRUE you get 2 (which is 1 + 1)
Think CPSC121. TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0

TEST: -->
TRUE + TRUE

<!-- You cannot add characters + doubles -->
"Fred" + 7

<!-- But you //CAN// add characters + logicals, Since TRUE = 1 -->
temp_today + TRUE

<!-- Double equals "==" means "is x = y" -->
name == "Adam" <!-- should return false -->


<!-- To comment (technically) -->
# comment
idk why its not working this way though
